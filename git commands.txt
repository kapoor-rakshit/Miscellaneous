Create a new repository on GitHub. 
To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. 
You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

Open Git Shell on Windows platform      (can be downloaded from official site)

Change the current working directory to your local project.

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
$ git init

Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit. Mind the '.'
$ git add .

Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
$ git commit -m "First commit"

In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
$ git remote add origin remote <--repository URL-->

Verifies the new remote URL
$ git remote -v

Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
$ git push origin master





Adding a file to a repository.
On your computer, move the file you'd like to upload to GitHub into the local directory that was created when you cloned the repository.

Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to your local repository.

Stage the file for commit to your local repository. Mind the '.'
$ git add .

Commit the file that you've staged in your local repository.
$ git commit -m "Add existing file"

Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
$ git push origin master




Cloning a repository
Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

Use git clone
$ git clone <--https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-->
