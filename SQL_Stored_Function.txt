-- A stored function is a set of SQL statements that perform some operation and return a single value.
-- Just like Mysql in-built function, it can be called from within a Mysql statement.

-- By default, the stored function is associated with the default database.
-- In order to associate routine explicitly with a specific database function name should be given as database_name.func_name

-- The CREATE FUNCTION statement require CREATE ROUTINE database privilege.

-- Syntax : CREATE FUNCTION function_name(func_parameter1 datatype, func_parameter2 datatype, ..)
--            RETURN datatype [characteristics]
--            func_body

-- function_name   : It is the name by which stored function is called. The name should not be same as native(built_in) function.
-- func_parameter  : It is the argument whose value is used by the function inside its body. You can’t specify to these parameters IN, OUT, INOUT.
-- datatype        : It is datatype of value returned by function.
-- characteristics : The CREATE FUNCTION statement is accepted only if at least one of the characterisitics is specified in its declaration.
--                    DETERMINISTIC  : A routine is considered “deterministic” if it always produces the same result for the same input parameters, and “not deterministic” (default) otherwise.
--                    NO SQL         : A routine contains no SQL statements.
--                    READS SQL DATA : A routine contains statements that read data (for example, SELECT), but not statements that write data.
-- func_body       : is the set of Mysql statements that perform operation. It's structure is as follows:
--                   BEGIN
--                    Mysql Statements
--                    RETURN expression;                         /* The function body must contain one RETURN statement */
--                   END
