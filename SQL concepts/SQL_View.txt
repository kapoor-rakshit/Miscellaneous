/* In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
   The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
   NOTE : a view does not physically store the data, so any DML command made to VIEW will effect original table(s).
*/

-- Syntax : CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;


/* 1 */
