The code can be converted to Python 3.x code via 2to3 on the command line:
$ 2to3 example.py
A diff against the original source file is printed on the command line and not on source file.


2to3 can also write the needed modifications right back to the source file with the -w flag:
$ 2to3 -w example.py
Changes applied to original and backup of the original is also made (example.py.bak)


To prevent backup of original file, -n flag also used:
$ 2to3 -w -n example.py
Changes applied to original and No backup file of original made


The -l flag lists all available fixers
$ 2to3 -l


An explicit set of fixers to run can be given with -f flag:
$ 2to3 -f imports -f has_key example.py
It runs only the imports and has_key fixers


the -x flag explicitly disables a fixer:
$ 2to3 -x apply example.py
It runs every fixer except the apply fixer
