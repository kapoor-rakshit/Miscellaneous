pip installation
 $ sudo apt-get install python-pip                    // LINUX
                                                      // WINDOWS , if python is installed on your system, then pip comes in handy.                                                                                            

pip is a command line program which can be run from the command prompt as follows:
 $ pip <pip arguments>


If you cannot run the pip command directly (possibly because the location where it was installed isn’t on your operating system’s PATH)
then you can run pip via the Python interpreter:
 $ python -m pip <pip arguments>


Requirements files are files containing a list of items to be installed using pip install:
 $ pip install -r <name_of_requirements_file>
 
 Generating requirements.txt
 By default, it will generate all packages installed on system using 'pip' command ever on system.
 To have packages only for specific project , it is recommended to have 'virtualenv' for each project.
   $ pip freeze > <name_of_requirements_file>
 
 Requirements file format
 Each line of the requirements file indicates something to be installed, just like args to 'pip install'.
 A line that begins with '#' is treated as a comment and ignored.
 A line ending in an unescaped '\' is treated as a line continuation and the newline following it is effectively ignored.
   -r <other_requirements.txt>                                 # refer to other requirements files
   beautifulsoup4                                              # without Version Specifiers
   docopt == 0.6.1                                             # Version Matching. Must be version 0.6.1
   keyring >= 4.1.1                                            # Minimum version 4.1.1
   coverage != 3.5                                             # Version Exclusion. Anything except version 3.5
