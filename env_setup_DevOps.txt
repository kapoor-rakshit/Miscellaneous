
Developer's     : job is to add new features.
Operations's    : job is to keep site stable and fast.
Tester's        : job is to reduce risk.



DevOps
            It solves customer problems
            It is for cloud
            It is a solution
            It is a tool
            It is a skill to master 

Agile breaks wall between Business and Development team.
DevOps breaks wall between Development and Operations team.



- Dev        : people involved in developing product.
- Ops        : system engineers, administrators, operations staff, release engineers, DBA, network engineers, security engineers.
- Agile      : collaboration of customers, product management, developers, QA
- DevOps     : extending principles of Agile to entire delivered service.
                      - improved deployment frequency.
                      - faster time to market.
                      - lower failure rate.
                      - shortened lead time between fixes.
                      - faster mean time to recovery in event of a new relaease crashing.
- CD          : Continuous Delivery
- CI          : Continuous Integration
- Lead time   : time between identification of requirement and it's fulfillment.
- Mean time to failure : time for which a system or application will last in operation.



DevOps practice involves
-----------------------------------
  PLAN --> CODE --> BUILD --> TEST --> INTEGRATE --> DEPLOY --> OPERATE --> MONITOR
- Continuous Development which needs Version control for all
- Automated and Continuous testing
- Proactive monitoring and metrics
- Configuration management
- Continuous Integration / Delivery / Deployment
- Virtualization / Coud / Containers
- Toolchain approach



DevOps tools
-------------------
Development
     Source Code Management or Continuous Development
           - Git
     Continuous Integration
           - Ant, Maven, Gradle    ( Build ie download required dependencies )
           - Jenkins, Travis       ( Platforms for orchestration )
           - Selenium, TestNG      ( WebDriver + Testing )
Operations
      Configuration Management
           - Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Saltstack
      Containers
           - Docker
      Monitoring
           - Nagios



CI workflow
----------------
- Commit changes to source code by developers.
- CI server pulls that code and triggers a build depending on schedule configured in CRON format at jenkins.
- Build application is deployed on testing server for testing.
- After testing application is deployed on production server.
- Concerned teams are constantly notified about build and test results.

Benefits of CI
------------------
- Reduced risk
- Bugs and problems discovered in time
- System is deployable more frequently, enabling more user feedback

Best practices of CI
-------------------------
- Maintain single source repository
- Everyone commits to master branch everyday
- Automate build
- Keep build fast
- Make build self testing
- Fix broken builds immediately
- Everyone can see what's happening
- Automate deployment

Jenkins
---------
- Jenkins is an orchestration and automation engine.
- It is extremely pluggable, with a lot of plug-ins emerged.
- The idea of CI is to merge code from individual developers into a project mulitple times per day and test continuously to avoid downstream problems.
- CD ensures that all merged code is always in a production ready state.
- Jenkins enables developers to automate this process as much as possible upto point of deployment



Continuous Deployment (CD)
---------------------------
- It is a business specific need and might not always required to be performed.
- Blue Green deployment method
  - A technique to reduce downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green
  - At anytime only one of environments is live , serving all production traffic.
- Rollback also is an important part of automated deployment.

CD enablers
----------------
- Comprehensive configuration management
- Containers
- Continuous Testing

Benefits of CD
--------------------
- Low risk releases
- Faster time to market
- Higher quality
- Lower costs
- Better products


CM ( Configuration Management )
--------------------------------------------
- To establish and maintain integrity of products of software project.
- It refers to discipline for evaluating, coordinating, approving or disapproving and implementing changes in artifacts that are used to construct and maintain software,
- An artifact is a piece of hardware or software or documentation.
- It controls inevitable changes.
- Without CM, team members can create versions without authority, use wrong version of artifact.
- It allows to scale the system by having one control machine and others can be host to scale to.

Chef
------
- A CM tool
- Recipe is a configuration script used in Chef
- Collection of scripts is called CookBook
- Tool with which scripts created, it is called Knife.
- Three entities Chef Server, Workstation, Nodes.
- Chef server is like a repository, Workstation is like development machine, Node is target system to which configuration needs to be applied.


Containers
-----------
- It packages application and it's dependencies together in form of a container.
- Containers are used by a container engine (Docker Engine) which is there on host OS.
- RAM consumed by containers is very less than that required by VM (virtual machine).
- Easily run applications containers , no need to reboot entire VM.
- Docker Images are light weight templates and shared via Docker Hub or Import/Export.

How are containers created ?
-----------------------------
- Docker file (Dockerfile) which contains commands are used to create Docker image and that image will contain all project codes.
- Docker image is used to spin "N" number of containers each with modifications to underlying image.
- Docker image is uploaded on Docker Hub and shared with others for testing / deployment.
