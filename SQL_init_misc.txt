/* SCHEMA */
-- In some database system schema represents a part of database or a collection of Tables, and collection of schema is a database.
-- However in MySQL schema is synonym of database. so CREATE SCHEMA is nothing but CREATE DATABASE.



/* USER, GRANTS, REVOKE */
-- when inside mysql shell to create new user
mysql> CREATE USER 'newusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';


-- delete user
-- mysql> DROP USER ‘username’@‘localhost’;

-- At this point newuser created has no permissions to do anything with the databases.
-- In fact, even if newuser tries to login (with the password, password), they will not be able to reach the MySQL shell.
-- we need to grant permissions to user for same.

/* PERMISSIONS */
-- ALL PRIVILEGES  allow a MySQL user full access to a designated database (or if no database is selected, global access across the system)
-- CREATE          allows them to create new tables or databases
-- DROP            allows them to them to delete tables or databases
-- DELETE          allows them to delete rows from tables
-- INSERT          allows them to insert rows into tables
-- SELECT          allows them to use the SELECT command to read through databases
-- UPDATE          allow them to update table rows
-- GRANT OPTION    allows them to grant or revoke other users’ privileges

-- Syntax : GRANT type_of_permission ON database_name.table_name TO ‘username’@'IP_ADDRESS_OF_MACHINE’;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost';        -- here ALL PRIVILEGES are granted on all databases (*) and on all tables (*)


-- To revoke a permission
-- Syntax : REVOKE type_of_permission ON database_name.table_name FROM ‘username’@‘localhost’;

-- default "mysql" DB contain grant information in following tables
-- user             : User accounts, static global privileges, and other nonprivilege columns.
-- db               : Database-level privileges.
-- tables_priv      : Table-level privileges.
-- columns_priv     : Column-level privileges.
-- procs_priv       : Stored procedure and function privileges.
